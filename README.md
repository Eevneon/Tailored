Hey! Welcome to Tailored's GitHub! You're new here? Well, let's explore what this mod is, and who I am. 

Firstly, I am Eevneon, but you can call me Eev. I am currently developing this mod on my own, but I'm always open for suggestions, and might ask for some people to join the team later on. 

Tailored is a mod that tries to alter Minecraft in such a way that it becomes more balanced, more consistent, but most of all, more fun! We do this by altering recipes, entities, blocks and other features, but also by adding things the community wants. It's important to know some features of this mod might be ported individually across several other projects I develop, but usually, if they're still relevant, the features will stay in Tailored. Summarized: Tailored is a mod full of features, to test how they can be properly balanced, and if there's any want for these features.

All the added features:
- None

All the planned features:
- Proper blast furnace recipes,
- The illager's bane enchantment, to deal more damage to illagers, like smite and bane of arthropods are to undead and insects + spiders respectively
- And further enchantment changes.
